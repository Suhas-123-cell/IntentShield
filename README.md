# IntentShield MCP MVP

IntentShield is an offline-first authorization gateway for tool-using AI agents. The MVP demonstrates that every proposed tool call is normalized, evaluated, audited, and either **ALLOW**, **REVIEW**, or **BLOCK** before any side effect can occur.

## What is implemented

- Deterministic policy enforcement with stable reason codes
- Registered-tool and schema-hash checks
- Tool allow/prohibit lists, argument validation, and resource/destination scope
- Call budgets, intent-alignment and injection signals
- Atomic idempotency protection for mutations; uncertain executor outcomes enter a persistent `IN_DOUBT` state and are never retried automatically
- Human approval bound to the exact run, tool, arguments, and expiry
- SQLite audit trail for runs, events, approvals, and executions
- Real MCP 2.2 client support over stdio and Streamable HTTP
- Guarded connections to multiple real upstream MCP servers over stdio or Streamable HTTP
- Upstream JSON Schema validation, namespaced tool identities, and fail-closed catalog drift checks
- Gemini-native function calling as the only remote model provider
- Evidence-only detection and grounding agents feeding the deterministic policy engine
- A locally trained DeBERTa-v3-small intent classifier with abstention and artifact integrity checks
- Model proposals normalized into the same deterministic policy and approval boundary
- A deterministic local MCP server and end-to-end harness; no API key or paid model required
- FastAPI endpoints and scripted benign, injection, and approval scenarios

## Run locally

Requires Python 3.12 or later.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
.venv/bin/intentshield
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. API documentation is available at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

The app loads `.env` automatically without overriding variables already exported
by the parent process. Scripted scenarios remain offline. Only live Gemini runs
need an API key.

Run the test suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

## Gemini model integration

The dashboard and `POST /api/model-runs` use Gemini to turn user intent into one
native function-call proposal. Gemini output is never trusted or executed
directly. IntentShield first runs local injection preflight, maps the proposed
function back to the registered tool, attaches the trusted schema hash and a
gateway-generated idempotency key for mutations, runs detection and grounding,
and finally invokes the deterministic policy and approval flow.

Copy the template and add the Gemini key locally. Never commit `.env` or paste
the key into the dashboard:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=
INTENTSHIELD_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
INTENTSHIELD_MODEL_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2
INTENTSHIELD_INTENT_MODEL_DIR=artifacts/intent-deberta-v3-small
```

`GET /api/models` reports Gemini readiness and the configured model name without
returning credential values. A missing key fails before any network request.
The adapter accepts exactly one known tool proposal, offers Gemini an explicit
safe no-action function, and fails closed on missing, multiple, malformed, or
unknown calls. Model requests are bounded by a server-side concurrency limit.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/model-runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"provider":"gemini","user_intent":"Read my two most recent inbox messages"}'
```

Only Gemini receives the user intent and registered public tool schemas, and
only after local injection preflight succeeds. API keys, policy configuration,
approval state, detector evidence, and tool results are not sent to Gemini. The
flow stops after the guarded tool result; it does not send the result back for a
second generation.

## Train the local intent classifier

Install the optional training runtime and fine-tune the checked-in,
template-group-disjoint dataset:

```bash
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements-ml.txt
.venv/bin/python -m intentshield.intent_training \
  --output artifacts/intent-deberta-v3-small \
  --epochs 24 \
  --learning-rate 5e-5
```

The trainer pins the resolved `microsoft/deberta-v3-small` revision, seeds the
run, uses safetensors, and writes `intent_metadata.json`, `label_map.json`, and
`evaluation_report.json`. The runtime verifies every file hash and refuses an
artifact unless validation macro-F1 is at least 0.90 and every trained class has
at least 0.80 recall. The trained families are `read`, `mutation`, and
`no_action`; `unknown` is a runtime abstention. This classifier supplies intent
evidence only—it is not an injection detector and cannot authorize execution.

Inspect readiness:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/security/status
```

## Real MCP proxy

IntentShield is an MCP server to the agent and an MCP client to the guarded
upstream server. The agent never receives a direct upstream connection.

The included demo config launches a real upstream MCP server over stdio:

```bash
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp \
  --transport streamable-http \
  --config configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8001
```

Point any MCP client at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp
```

The proxy exposes five stable MCP tools:

- `intentshield_create_run`
- `intentshield_list_tools`
- `intentshield_call`
- `intentshield_get_run`
- `intentshield_get_approval`

A client creates a run using the user's exact intent, reads the guarded catalog,
and sends the selected tool name, arguments, and exact `schema_hash` to
`intentshield_call`. `BLOCK` and `REVIEW` never contact the upstream tool.

Verify the complete policy and wiring before connecting an agent:

```bash
# Fast in-process preflight
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp-verify --config configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json

# Real downstream stdio subprocess
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp-verify --config configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json --stdio

# A running Streamable HTTP gateway
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp-verify \
  --config configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp
```

The verifier discovers every upstream, checks policy coverage and schemas, then
proves that an unregistered canary is `BLOCK` and a safe mutation proposal is
`REVIEW` with `executed=false`. Mutation verification uses the gateway's
non-persistent `dry_run` path, so it neither executes nor creates an approval
that could later be granted.

To exercise both upstream transports together, start the HTTP fixture in one
terminal and verify the mixed config from another:

```bash
# Terminal 1: real Streamable HTTP upstream
.venv/bin/intentshield-demo-mcp \
  --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8010

# Terminal 2: real stdio client -> IntentShield -> stdio + HTTP upstreams
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp-verify \
  --config configs/mcp-proxy.mixed-demo.json --stdio
```

No API key is needed for the deterministic demo or mixed-transport harness.

To run the web dashboard and Gemini proposal path against that same real MCP
catalog rather than the simulated tools, set:

```dotenv
INTENTSHIELD_PROXY_CONFIG=configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json
INTENTSHIELD_CONTROL_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-value
```

Then start `.venv/bin/intentshield`. The FastAPI lifespan opens the configured
upstream connections, Gemini sees the guarded qualified catalog, and every
proposal reaches the same policy-bound MCP executor used by the proxy server.
Enter the same control token in the dashboard's approval queue field; it stays
in memory and is sent only as a bearer credential to the local approval API.
The web proxy refuses to start without this token.

The real HTTP upstream, downstream, authenticated control endpoint, and clean
shutdown path also have an opt-in process-level test:

```bash
INTENTSHIELD_RUN_HTTP_E2E=1 \
  .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_mcp_http_e2e.py
```

### Human approval for mutations

Approval is intentionally not an agent-callable MCP tool. For the HTTP mode,
enable the localhost control endpoint with a high-entropy bearer token:

```bash
export INTENTSHIELD_CONTROL_TOKEN="replace-with-a-long-random-value"
.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp \
  --transport streamable-http \
  --config configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8001
```

After an MCP call returns `REVIEW` and an `approval_id`, a trusted operator can
approve it:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTENTSHIELD_CONTROL_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decision":"approve"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8001/control/approvals/APPROVAL_ID
```

The endpoint is absent when `INTENTSHIELD_CONTROL_TOKEN` is unset. Bind to
localhost unless you have added TLS and a production authentication layer.

### Configure another upstream server

Use the `upstreams` array to connect one or more servers. For a local stdio
server that needs an API key:

```json
{
  "upstreams": [
    {
      "server_id": "filesystem",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/server-command",
      "args": ["--flag", "value"],
      "env_from_env": {
        "UPSTREAM_API_KEY": "INTENTSHIELD_FILESYSTEM_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Export the secret locally. The JSON contains only its environment-variable
name:

```bash
export INTENTSHIELD_FILESYSTEM_API_KEY="your-real-key"
```

You can keep local values in `.env` by copying `.env.example` and editing the
placeholders:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

IntentShield loads `.env` automatically. `.env` is ignored by Git; keep the
placeholder-only `.env.example` committed. Variables already present in the
process environment take precedence over `.env`.

For a deployed Streamable HTTP server, place the complete header value in an
environment variable—for example, `Bearer ...`—and reference it with
`headers_from_env`:

```json
{
  "upstreams": [
    {
      "server_id": "remote",
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "headers_from_env": {
        "Authorization": "INTENTSHIELD_REMOTE_AUTHORIZATION"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
export INTENTSHIELD_REMOTE_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer your-real-token"
```

Missing or empty referenced variables fail startup. Credential values are
redacted from connection metadata, tool results, exceptions and verifier JSON.
Do not put API-key values directly in committed configuration files. A complete
template is available at `configs/mcp-proxy.real.example.json`.

`read_only_tools` is a local trust decision. Every upstream tool not explicitly
listed there is treated as a mutation and requires idempotency plus human
approval. Upstream descriptions and MCP annotations are never trusted to lower
that classification. Raw upstream descriptions are withheld by default; set
`expose_upstream_descriptions` only for a server whose catalog you trust. Every
returned tool result is labeled `UNTRUSTED_MCP_OUTPUT` for downstream agents.
`allowed_tools` defaults to an empty list, so each deployment must deliberately
allow exact names or scoped patterns such as `filesystem:read_*`.
All patterns and resource/destination rules must use qualified
`server_id:tool_name` identities. Per-tool scope rules use
`resource_fields` with `allowed_resources_by_tool`, or `destination_fields`
with `allowed_destinations_by_tool`; global scope lists are rejected for MCP
proxy configurations to prevent policy bleeding between servers. Every allowed
tool must also have a nonempty `grounding_terms_by_tool` entry containing the
operator-owned nouns that must appear in the user's request, such as `note`,
`invoice`, or `status`. Startup fails if a discovered allowed tool has no such
entry. When wildcard allow rules are used, map every tool they can admit.

For desktop clients that launch MCP subprocesses, use the absolute executable
and config paths:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "IntentShield": {
      "command": "/Users/suhasdev/Documents/IntentShield/.venv/bin/intentshield-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--transport", "stdio",
        "--config", "/Users/suhasdev/Documents/IntentShield/configs/mcp-proxy.demo.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The Streamable HTTP mode is recommended when the protected human approval
endpoint is needed. This MVP deliberately refuses non-loopback downstream HTTP
bindings; place an authenticated TLS reverse proxy or a production MCP auth
layer in front before remote deployment. Remote upstream URLs must use HTTPS;
plain HTTP upstreams are accepted only on loopback. The stdio mode is useful for
read-only tools and embedded applications that provide their own trusted
approval UI.

## API

- `GET /api/health`
- `POST /api/runs`
- `GET /api/models`
- `GET /api/security/status`
- `POST /api/model-runs`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/events`
- `GET /api/approvals`
- `POST /api/approvals/{approval_id}/decision`
- `GET /api/tools`
- `GET /api/metrics`

Create a scripted run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_intent":"Read my inbox","scenario":"benign"}'
```

Use `"scenario":"injection"` to demonstrate a blocked attack or
`"scenario":"review"` to create an approval request. Scripted scenarios are
available in local simulated mode; set `INTENTSHIELD_PROXY_CONFIG` for live MCP
catalog and execution from the web dashboard.

When the web dashboard uses a real MCP proxy, both approval endpoints require
`Authorization: Bearer <INTENTSHIELD_CONTROL_TOKEN>`. The local simulated mode
can run without a token for development.

## Security boundary

Model output, upstream tool descriptions, schemas, annotations, and results are
untrusted input. Gemini may propose a call; detection, grounding, and DeBERTa
produce immutable evidence only. None can approve or execute. The deterministic
policy engine remains the sole authorization boundary and the service remains
the sole executor path. IntentShield validates arguments against the bound
upstream schema before invoking MCP. Catalog drift fails closed until restart.
Agent-visible schemas remove untrusted annotation text while retaining the
original schema internally for validation and hashing. Request arguments,
catalogs, schemas, model responses, and result sizes are bounded.
